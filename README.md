# Chip-8 Emulator

My attempt at an original Chip-8 Emulator using Python, currently developing. I referenced [Cowgod's Chip-8 Techincal Reference](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) to develop this as well as various documents on assembly instructions.

## Features

 - [x] OpenGL 3.3 based using programmable pipeline
 - [x] Window based with GUI
 - [x] Basic ROM support
 - [ ] Support for loading/saving states
 - [ ] Sound
 - [ ] Remappable keyboard input

## Dependencies

The emulator should run on any system with the following dependencies:

Python 3

    sudo apt install python3

PyOpenGL

    pip3 install PyOpenGL
